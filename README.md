### Hey folks, :wave:

My name is **Jared Goldman** and I'm a full-stack software developer and open-source contributor originating from Canada. After being fascinated with computers and tech my entire life, I finally started coding during the pandemic. I quickly fell down a deep, beautiful rabbit hole and continue to have my mind blown on daily basis keeping up with the latest in web and software dev. I love the web, creating beautiful dynamic UIs and building scalable backend infrastructure and
I'm also starting to explore native software dvelopment computer science, data structures and alogrithms. My skillset includes TS/JS, Python, Java, React (Next.Js, Gatsby), PHP, HTML/CSS, Svelte, ExpressJS, Postgres, MongoDb, Docker, Discord.js and AWS (EC2, Amplify). Nice to be acquainted!

#### What I'm up to:

:computer: I have recently switched from MacOS to Arch Linux w/ i3-wm and am never going back.    
:drum: I'm a musician and I'm obsessed with jazz, klezmer music and vintage cymbals
